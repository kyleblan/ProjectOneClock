# ProjectOneClock

- This project shows a 24hr and 12hr clock that responds to user input.
- I think that the UI here is straightforward. 
- To improve, I would remove certain functionality and branching from main and define user functions to replace it. 
- The logic branching here was the most difficult part of approaching this program. I overcame this by using if/else logic. 
- This project helped me learn key lessons about working with multi-file projects.
- The use of comments should help maintain this code, as it is small in scope.
